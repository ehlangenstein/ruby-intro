# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 5
# puts 2
# puts 2+5
# puts 5*2 
# puts 5-2
# puts 5/2.0
# puts (5-2)*3

# # Non-numbers
# puts "Hello, world!"
# puts "Tacos are " + "delish"
# puts "tacos" * 3

# puts 3*"tacos" - have to do the *3 after text


# # Variables
# x=5
# y=2

# zebra = 8

# puts zebra*x

# food = "tacos"
# quantity = 3 
# puts food*quantity

# Combine strings and variables
# puts "i want 3 tacos"
# puts "i want #{quantity} tacos"

# puts "I want #{quantity} #{food}"

# name = "Ben"
# puts "hello, #{name}!"
# String manipulation


# True, False

# puts true

puts 3 == 2 

# Nothing
